## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

You can host this game for free on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    *   Create a new **public** repository on your GitHub account.

2.  **Upload the Files:**
    *   Upload all the files from this project (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `README.md`, the `components`, `services`, and `types` folders, etc.) to your new repository.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   In your repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    *   Under "Build and deployment", for the **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   For the **Branch**, select `main` (or your default branch) and `/ (root)` for the folder.
    *   Click **Save**.

4.  **Wait and Play!**
    *   GitHub will take a minute or two to build and deploy your site.
    *   Once it's ready, the URL for your game will be displayed at the top of the GitHub Pages settings page. It will look something like this: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.
    *   Share the link and enjoy the party!
